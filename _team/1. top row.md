bio: I gained a lot of development skills that I had no prior experience with. One major area I gained experience in was testing, as I had the opportunity to create system, acceptance, and integration tests which I’d never done before. I also only had a very small amount of unit testing experience and no experience using JUnit, so I’m glad I got some more practice in that area. I’d also never made a GUI in Java before (and never used Java Swing before), so that was another area I gained valuable skills in. This project was also the first time I’d ever used git, so I gained really valuable experience in version control and how collaboration works on team projects.
