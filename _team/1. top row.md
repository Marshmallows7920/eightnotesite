bio: I gained a lot of development skills that I had no prior experience with. One major area I gained experience in was testing, as I had the opportunity to create system, acceptance, and integration tests which I’d never done before. I also only had a very small amount of unit testing experience and no experience using JUnit, so I’m glad I got some more practice in that area. I’d also never made a GUI in Java before (and never used Java Swing before), so that was another area I gained valuable skills in. This project was also the first time I’d ever used git, so I gained really valuable experience in version control and how collaboration works on team projects.

bio2: This project taught me a lot about working in a team environment and gave me invaluable experience that I’ll carry forward. I learned the importance of each team member’s role in contributing to a project's success — especially how effective communication can help build trust and foster collaboration. On the technical side, key takeaways include working in an Agile development environment, writing clean, maintainable code, and using Git for version control.
