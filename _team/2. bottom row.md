bio: Throughout the project, I’ve gained valuable experience in working with a team. Working with others involves constant communication, including checking in on where others are at in their tasks and where help is needed. Designing a project as a team is very different than designing a project as a solo member, as design ideas can vary from team member to team member. I learned that making everyone’s voice heard during team meetings is important, as we work towards our goal of reaching a consensus for the tasks that need to be done during each iteration.

bio2: I learned a lot about working with java. Specifically, making a full application with java swing since it was very different from all the other courses that we go through. This also helped me learn about the limitations of using this type of tool for the application since it seems to be more geared for prototyping. I also learned how to work through different obstacles when life has an attitude but there are deadlines that have to be met in a production environment.
