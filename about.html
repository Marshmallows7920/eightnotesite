                    By combining journaling and music, Eighth Note will help music-lovers build an archive of meaningful songs and memories. Eighth Note will be considered successful if journal users prefer the app over traditional journaling options and find the app intuitive, which can be measured through surveys. We would consider this criteria met if at least 80% of app users who fill out surveys indicate that they feel this way. With the added ability for journalers to keep track of how many days in a row they have engaged with the journal, we can use this feature to gauge how frequently music-lovers are logging into the app with the hope that 50% of them journal 3 times a week.
